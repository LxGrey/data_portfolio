## Software Projects:


## [Software Project 1: Github Followers iOS App](https://github.com/LxGrey/GHFollowers)
* Technologies used: Swift, UIKit, Firebase, CoreData, SafariServices, Codable, DiffableData, Git, GitHub API)

* Functionality: 
  * search for a GitHub user 
  * pull a list of their followers 
  * search through their followers' followers 
  * view GitHub profiles in-app (Safari ViewController) 
  * save interesting profiles to a favorites list that syncs to the cloud

* Followed guide for base concept and design; expanded by adding cloud database (Firebase), custom error-handling, custom UI elements, edge-case optimization, iPad adaptibilty, and refactored Networking for faster downloading/caching
